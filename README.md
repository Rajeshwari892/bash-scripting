# bash-scripting

This is the repository where we are going to learn bash and would like to automate our project.

#### Also I'll give names as 00 , 01 ,02 ,03  to indicate the sequence to learn.


#### Few of the git commands that we would use during our upcoming journey 

1)  git clone repoName       :  Download the whole repository 
2)  git pull                 :  Download only the changes 
3)  git add fileName         :  Git will start tracking the you're making on the file named fileName 
4)  git commig -m "msg Name" :  Adding Msg to the commit / changes that you made .
5)  git push                 :  Your changes will be pushed to the repo.

### PS: Ensure you are inside the repo to executre the git commands  ; We will perform clone once and pull multiple times
